# Grading-Analysis-Tool
This is an Educational Data Mining tool. It reads data from an university and makes analysis of its contents. Created by Luisa Rosa, with Dr.Daniel Leeds, Dr.Gary Weiss, and Ashley Saliasi at Fordham University.

The main goal is to analyze instructor grading in a more sophisticated way. In the same way that students have freedom when selecting university courses, instructors can have different grading criteria and policies. Usually, professors assign grades with great discretion. Grading can impact how hard a student prepares for an exam and the effort put into the class. It is essential to understand these different grading patterns.

Our publicly available python-based educational data mining tool helps to identify instructor and department grading patterns, consistently having high (or low) grading over many years, courses, and instructors. It performs detailed data analysis and generates understandable instructor grading assessments.
